🏦 Banking System in C++ (OOP Based)

This project is a menu-driven Banking System implemented in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.

It allows users to create and manage different types of bank accounts and perform common banking operations.

📌 Features

Abstract base class BankAccount

Derived account types:

💰 Savings Account

🧾 Checking Account

📈 Fixed Deposit Account

Runtime polymorphism using virtual functions

Dynamic memory management with base-class pointers

Menu-driven console interface

🧠 OOP Concepts Used

Abstraction: BankAccount contains pure virtual function calculateInterest()

Inheritance: Specialized account classes inherit from BankAccount

Polymorphism: Virtual functions enable runtime method overriding

Encapsulation: Balance is kept private and accessed via member functions

⚙️ Functionalities
